<p>HeadVR (https://github.com/autoandshare/HeadVR) is a open source VR video player for android. </p>
<p>It is controlled by head motion, e.g., nod or shake of the head. (Gyroscope sensor is necessary)</p>
<p>It supports 2D and 3D video (360 video not supported yet).
    For 3D video, file name should include 'SBS' or 'TAB' (https://kodi.wiki/view/3D#Video_filenames_flags).
